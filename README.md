# Project Brain-games includes 5 console games:
brain-even (parity check),

brain-calc (calculator),

brain-gcd (greatest common divisor),

brain-progression (Arithmetic progression),

brain-prime (Is it a prime number?)

##brain-even:
A random number is shown to the user. And he needs to answer yes if the number is even, or no if it is odd.
If the answer is correct the question is repeated twice more. If the answer is wrong, the game ends.

##brain-calc:
The user is shown a random mathematical expression that needs to be calculated and written down the correct answer. If the answer is correct the question is repeated twice more. If the answer is wrong, the game ends.

##brain-gcd:
The user is shown two random numbers. The user must calculate and enter the greatest common divisor of these numbers. If the answer is correct the question is repeated twice more. If the answer is wrong, the game ends.

##brain-progression:
The player is shown a series of numbers forming an arithmetic progression, replacing any of the numbers with two dots. The player must determine this number. If the answer is correct the question is repeated twice more. If the answer is wrong, the game ends.

##brain-prime:
A random number is shown to the user. And he needs to answer yes if the number is prime, or no if it is odd.
If the answer is correct the question is repeated twice more. If the answer is wrong, the game ends.
